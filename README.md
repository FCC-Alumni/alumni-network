## Fun while it lasted...
This was a fun project, but it's time to call it quits and archive this repo (considering it's been dormant for quite some time now and the server's been down for a few years :smile:). Thanks to everyone who helped build FCCAN and to our users when we were live! I hope everyone had as much fun as I did.

Be well and stay safe out there,

Pete

freeCodeCamp has an incredible and vibrant international community. We built this app specifically to try and cultivate relationships among experienced campers.

Currently, the [FCC Forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/freeCodeCamp), and other resources provide ample opportunities for campers at any skill level. We wanted to create an environment specifically for more experienced campers who are looking for advanced collaborative projects or mentorship opportunities, as a mentor or mentee.

Our authentication process verifies the FCC progress of users, and only admits students who have completed at least one FCC Certificate (Note: User's will have to make their FCC profiles public for this validation to work).

Our goal is to create a focused community of like-minded individuals who can benefit from each others culminated experience and expertise, whether in new technologies, programming skills, or career advice.
